<h2><u>Aspiration Summary</u></h2> <!-- Summary of my desire to become a web developer -->

<p>I consider myself a learner and a problem solver.   
I have a strong desire to stretch my brain and see how far it can go. Always leaving me with something else to learn.
I love finding solutions and formulating systems that take the most complicated process and simplify
it into something that can be functional for everyone. That is coding and that is why I really want to learn web development.
I do have an artistic background and so I would enjoy putting together the perfect website with colors and placement that make the page inviting to
users, but I believe my passion is in the back end of web development.  The side that makes the website tick.  I am excited about learning
 how to become a full stack developer and hope you can see that I would be an excellent choice for this opportunity.</div></p>
