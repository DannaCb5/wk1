# Week 1 of Clubhouse Bootcamp

This is the first week of the Full Stack Developer bootcamp taught by Schuster Braun.

In week one we learned how to access and use Github, Slack and Codepen.

## First Project
My very first HTML project called My first Web Page was a project I did at home to qualify for the class.  It is very basic and includes images and links along with other basic tags.  I went to w3schools.com for instructional information and coolors.co to select colors for the background and border.

## Island Girl
This is my first project at bootcamp. The project was to create a character or use and exiting character as the focus.  I learned how to use inline-block, position and float to locate images.
